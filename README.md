# Text Expander

This repository contains my solution to the challenge of utilizing props as a component API and improving component's reusability. The challenge exercise focuses on creating a React component that expands and collapses text with configurable options.

## Challenge Description

In this challenge, I implemented a TextExpander component in React that allows the user to toggle between expanded and collapsed text. The component utilizes props to provide flexibility and reusability. It showcases the concept of using props as a component API to render dynamic content within the component.

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript
- CSS

## Installation and Usage

To get a local copy of this project up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mohdShahwan/text-expander.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd text-expander`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.

## Challenge Solution

In my solution, I created the TextExpander component that allows text to be expanded and collapsed based on the specified number of words. The component accepts various props to customize its behavior, such as the number of words to show in the collapsed state, button texts, button color, and initial expansion state.

The code demonstrates the following concepts:

- Utilizing props to configure component behavior.
- Using state to manage the expanded/collapsed state of the text.
- Splitting and joining text based on the number of words.
- Creating a reusable Button component to handle click events.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different use cases.
